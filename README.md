# Adidas Sales Prediction (Time Series) ðŸ“Š
In this project, I developed a time series model to predict Adidas sales by analyzing seasonal patterns and trends. The goal was to build a robust forecasting model that can help in understanding sales dynamics over time and provide accurate sales predictions for future periods.

Project Overview
Objective: To analyze seasonal sales trends and predict future Adidas sales using time series modeling.
Data: The dataset contains historical sales data of Adidas, covering various seasons and time periods.
Methodology: I employed the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, a widely used time series forecasting technique, to capture the underlying patterns and make predictions.
Tools and Libraries: The project was implemented using Python, with key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting the data into a time series format suitable for analysis.
Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand seasonal trends and patterns in the sales data.
Seasonal Analysis:

Decomposing the time series data to identify and analyze the seasonal, trend, and residual components.
Visualizing seasonal effects to understand how sales fluctuate throughout the year.
ARIMA Model Implementation:

Building the ARIMA model to forecast future sales based on historical data.
Optimizing model parameters to improve the accuracy of predictions.
Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Sales Prediction:

Generating forecasts for future periods and visualizing the predicted sales against actual sales data.
Analyzing forecast results to provide actionable insights for inventory management and marketing strategies.
Conclusion
The Adidas Sales Prediction project offers a comprehensive analysis of seasonal sales patterns and provides accurate forecasts using the ARIMA model. This project can be a valuable tool for businesses looking to optimize their inventory and marketing strategies based on reliable sales predictions.
